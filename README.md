**Staff Cloud Architect | AI/ML Platform Engineering | 15+ Years Enterprise Strategy**

Building the scalable foundations that let engineering teams ship faster—without the 2 AM pages.

## 🏗️ Architectural Vision & Business Impact

I bridge the gap between complex cloud architecture and organizational growth. With over 15 years of experience, I design the scalable, cost-efficient foundations that allow engineering teams to ship faster without compromising security.

**Current Focus at Workday:** Leading the operationalization of Generative AI (RAG, Bedrock) and SageMaker workflows at enterprise scale.

**Financial Stewardship:** Delivered $400K+ in cumulative cloud savings by implementing organizational FinOps standards and automated right-sizing.

**Strategic Enablement:** Transitioning from "implementation" to "enablement"—building the guardrails that empower 10+ squads to deploy with 99.99% reliability.

## 🚀 Featured Architectural Repos

These projects demonstrate Staff-level influence: cross-team standardization and production-grade reliability.

### 🤖 [Enterprise RAG Architecture on AWS](https://github.com/soodrajesh/mcp-ecs-s3-api-poc)

**Staff Perspective:** Operationalizing LLM capabilities (Claude/Bedrock) into enterprise workflows.

Built an MCP server that lets Claude and other AI models read and summarize documents from S3. Uses ECS Fargate, Lambda, API Gateway, and Bedrock. Everything's in Terraform because clicking buttons in the console doesn't scale.

**Focus:** Multi-region scalability, automated IAM scoping, and modular AI integration to reduce developer friction.

**Tech:** `AWS ECS` `Bedrock` `S3` `Lambda` `API Gateway` `Terraform` `Docker` `Python`

---

### 🏛️ [Enterprise ML Infrastructure Platform](https://github.com/soodrajesh/my-cloud-ai-demo)

**Staff Perspective:** A blueprint for a secure, multi-tenant ML platform on EKS and SageMaker.

Complete ML platform with EKS, SageMaker, and API Gateway. Has CI/CD via GitHub Actions and deployment scripts that actually work. Made it so data scientists can deploy models without needing to understand Kubernetes networking.

**Focus:** Abstracting Kubernetes complexity for Data Scientists, standardizing the path from local development to production serving.

**Tech:** `AWS EKS` `SageMaker` `S3` `API Gateway` `Terraform` `GitHub Actions` `Docker` `Python`

---

### 🔄 [Organizational GitOps Standard (ArgoCD)](https://github.com/soodrajesh/argocd-setup)

**Staff Perspective:** Moving beyond "setup" to Enterprise Governance.

Production-ready ArgoCD setup with RBAC, monitoring, and security policies. One-command deployment that doesn't skip the important stuff.

**Focus:** OIDC integration, custom RBAC, and multi-tenant security policies to enforce Zero-Trust deployment standards.

**Tech:** `ArgoCD` `Kubernetes` `RBAC` `Prometheus` `OIDC` `TLS`

---

### 📊 [SRE Reliability Framework](https://github.com/soodrajesh/k8s-grafana-prometheus)

**Staff Perspective:** Strategic monitoring stack focused on SLIs/SLOs that impact the bottom line.

Prometheus, Grafana, and AlertManager for Kubernetes. Configured with the metrics that actually matter, not just the defaults that come out of the box.

**Focus:** Reducing MTTR through centralized observability patterns and actionable alerting for large-scale clusters.

**Tech:** `Kubernetes` `Prometheus` `Grafana` `AlertManager` `Helm` `Node Exporter`

---

### 🔌 [OpenAI on Kubernetes](https://github.com/soodrajesh/openai-eks-project1)

Flask API using GPT-4o mini, containerized and running on EKS. A straightforward example of deploying an AI-powered API without overcomplicating things.

**Tech:** `AWS EKS` `Kubernetes` `OpenAI API` `Flask` `Docker` `GitHub Actions`

## 🤝 High-Stakes Partnership

I partner with leadership teams to solve:

- **Scaling AI/ML** from fragile PoCs to resilient, global production systems
- **Refactoring Legacy Cloud debt** into automated, self-healing IaC frameworks
- **Aggressive Cloud Cost Reduction** without sacrificing system performance
- **Security Audits** that keep finding issues—I've probably fixed something similar
- **CI/CD pipelines** that break more than they help

## 📝 What I'm Writing About

I actively write about MLOps and Cloud Strategy on [Medium](https://medium.com/@soodrajesh) to share architectural lessons learned over 15 years. Sharing what I've learned (and the mistakes I've made) so others don't have to repeat them.
