Hi, I'm Rajesh Sood, MBA 👋

Staff Cloud Architect | AI/ML Platform Engineering | 15+ Years Enterprise Strategy

🏗️ Architectural Vision & Business Impact

I bridge the gap between complex cloud architecture and organizational growth. With over 15 years of experience, I design the scalable, cost-efficient foundations that allow engineering teams to ship faster without compromising security.

Current Focus at Workday: Leading the operationalization of Generative AI (RAG, Bedrock) and SageMaker workflows at enterprise scale.

Financial Stewardship: Delivered $400K+ in cumulative cloud savings by implementing organizational FinOps standards and automated right-sizing.

Strategic Enablement: Transitioning from "implementation" to "enablement"—building the guardrails that empower 10+ squads to deploy with 99.99% reliability.

🛠️ Specialized Mastery

architectural_pillars:
  platforms: [AWS (Professional Certified), Azure, GCP, OCI]

🚀 Featured Architectural Repos

These projects demonstrate Staff-level influence: focus on cross-team standardization and production-grade reliability.

🤖 Enterprise RAG Architecture on AWS

Staff Perspective: Operationalizing LLM capabilities (Claude/Bedrock) into enterprise workflows.

Focus: Multi-region scalability, automated IAM scoping, and modular AI integration to reduce developer friction.

🏛️ Enterprise ML Infrastructure Platform

Staff Perspective: A blueprint for a secure, multi-tenant ML platform on EKS and SageMaker.

Focus: Abstracting Kubernetes complexity for Data Scientists, standardizing the path from local development to production serving.

🔄 Organizational GitOps Standard (ArgoCD)

Staff Perspective: Moving beyond "setup" to Enterprise Governance.

Focus: Features OIDC integration, custom RBAC, and multi-tenant security policies to enforce Zero-Trust deployment standards.

📊 SRE Reliability Framework

Staff Perspective: Strategic monitoring stack focused on SLIs/SLOs that impact the bottom line.

Focus: Reducing MTTR through centralized observability patterns and actionable alerting for large-scale clusters.

📜 Certifications & Leadership

AWS Solutions Architect – Professional: Valid through Dec 2026.

MBA (Information Technology): Leveraging business acumen to align technical debt reduction with corporate ROI.

Community Mentorship: I actively write about MLOps and Cloud Strategy on Medium to share architectural lessons learned over 15 years.

🤝 High-Stakes Partnership

I partner with leadership teams to solve:

Scaling AI/ML from fragile PoCs to resilient, global production systems.

Refactoring Legacy Cloud debt into automated, self-healing IaC frameworks.

Aggressive Cloud Cost Reduction without sacrificing system performance.
